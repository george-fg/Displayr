Displayr

Introduction:

Our Minimum Viable Product(MVP) is a homepage displaying a button + the Google Maps API map. When the button is clicked, it displays all the cycle routes around the Enspiral Dev Academy building.

As a stretch goal we will add different buttons that show different layers/locations.

Tools Needed:

Google Maps API

HTML

CSS

Handlebars module

Express module

Goals:

Use an API.

Use handlebars to render.

Use a few small, simple tests in TDD.
